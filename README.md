<span>Hi there! 👋🏻</span>
<br>
<br>
<span>I am a computational biology PhD student working in the Molecular Oncology and Immunology Lab at <a href=https://www.ifom.eu/en>IFOM</a>.</span>
<br>
<span>I am interested in biology at single-cell resolution with a bit of spatial information added to the mix as well, the rest of the time I'm usually cycling.</span>
<br>
<span>I use GitLab at work, so these here are just some projects mostly out of curiosity.</span>
